# litefupzl

`litefupzl` is a lightweight browser runner for checking that a
cookie-authenticated forum session can log in, pass browser challenges, and
perform human-like read activity.

It does not reply, create topics, or run lottery actions. The only optional
write action is the bounded mutual-like pass described below.

## Features

- Browser challenge prewarm and challenge handling before authenticated work.
- Cookie login proof with authenticated browser-session checks.
- Read-only topic browsing with human-like scrolling and retry behavior.
- Per-run never-read topic quota derived from a 30-day target.
- Optional mutual-like pass for configured usernames.
- Per-browser `/topics/timings` status diagnostics in redacted logs.
- Optional cookie refresh with validation before writing a GitHub secret.
- Manual and scheduled runs share the same cookie-refresh switch.
- GitHub Actions run cleanup with recent-run retention.
- Artifact upload is disabled by default and must be enabled per manual run.

## Local use

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
python -m pytest -q
```

Create a local `.env.local` when running outside GitHub Actions:

```env
LITEFUPZL_COOKIES_JSON=["_t=<account1_redacted>"]
LITEFUPZL_DURATION_MINUTES=5
# Optional quota overrides; these are the built-in defaults.
LITEFUPZL_MONTHLY_TOPIC_TARGET=500
LITEFUPZL_SCHEDULE_RUNS_PER_DAY=2
LITEFUPZL_TOPIC_PREFETCH_PAGES=7
LITEFUPZL_TOPIC_PREFETCH_MAX_PAGES=10
LITEFUPZL_HEADLESS=true
LITEFUPZL_BROWSER=chromium
LITEFUPZL_PROXY_SERVER=
LITEFUPZL_VIRTUAL_DISPLAY=true
LITEFUPZL_OUTPUT_DIR=output/litefupzl
LITEFUPZL_COOKIE_REFRESH_ENABLED=true
LITEFUPZL_MUTUAL_LIKE_USERS_JSON=[]
```

Run the main job:

```powershell
python apps/litefupzl/main.py
```

Run diagnostics:

```powershell
python apps/litefupzl/auth_probe.py
python apps/litefupzl/probe_browser.py
python apps/litefupzl/cf_probe.py
```

## Cookie format

`LITEFUPZL_COOKIES_JSON` must be a JSON array of cookie strings:

```json
["_t=<account1_redacted>"]
```

Multiple accounts are supported by adding more cookie strings to the same JSON
array:

```json
[
  "_t=<account1_redacted>",
  "_t=<account2_redacted>",
  "_t=<account3_redacted>"
]
```

Use only the durable login cookie. Do not add short-lived browser/session
cookies such as `_forum_session` or `cf_clearance`.

The main run processes cookie slots sequentially. Each array item is
assigned a public slot alias such as `slot-001`, `slot-002`, and so on. Probe
commands are quick diagnostics and currently use only the first cookie slot.

## GitHub Actions setup

Configure sensitive values as repository Secrets. Non-sensitive settings may
use repository Variables; Variables take priority, with Secrets retained as a
backward-compatible fallback.

`Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions`

### Secrets

#### `LITEFUPZL_COOKIES_JSON`

Required. A JSON array of cookie strings used by the browser session.

Single-account example:

```json
["_t=<account1_redacted>"]
```

Multi-account example:

```json
[
  "_t=<account1_redacted>",
  "_t=<account2_redacted>"
]
```

#### `LITEFUPZL_ACTIONS_ADMIN_TOKEN`

Optional. A GitHub token used only when you enable cookie refresh or need
workflow-run cleanup permissions beyond the default workflow token.

Recommended permissions:

- `actions:read`
- `actions:write`
- `secrets:write`

Do not place this token in code, commits, logs, or artifacts.

### Variables or Secrets

#### `LITEFUPZL_MUTUAL_LIKE_USERS_JSON`

Optional. A JSON array of usernames for the bounded mutual-like pass.

Example:

```json
["user_a", "user_b", "user_c"]
```

Missing, empty, malformed, or `[]` disables mutual-like entirely.

When enabled, each cookie slot independently:

1. waits until roughly half of that slot's read duration has elapsed;
2. fetches each target user's recent replies and topic first posts from the
   last 30 days;
3. processes candidates from oldest to newest;
4. skips content that is already liked, not likeable, or belongs to the
   current account;
5. sends at most 25 likes total for that slot.

The per-target quota is `floor(25 / username_count)`. For example, three
target usernames allow at most eight likes per target in one slot. If more than
25 usernames are configured, the per-target quota is zero and the pass is
skipped for that slot.

This value may be stored in Variables or Secrets. Prefer Secrets if the target
usernames are sensitive operational data.

### Additional Variables or Secrets

#### `LITEFUPZL_SITE`

Forum host name. Default: `linux.do`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_DURATION_MINUTES`

Default read duration per cookie slot when the manual input is empty. Default:
`40`.

Slots run sequentially, not in parallel. For example, if this is `40` and
`LITEFUPZL_COOKIES_JSON` contains two accounts, the main work can run
for about `40 + 40 = 80` minutes, plus setup, login verification, probes, and
cleanup overhead. Keep the workflow timeout in mind when adding more accounts.

#### `LITEFUPZL_MONTHLY_TOPIC_TARGET`

Minimum number of never-read topics targeted in a fixed 30-day period. Default:
`500`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_SCHEDULE_RUNS_PER_DAY`

Number of scheduled runs per day used for quota calculation. Default: `2`,
matching the two cron entries in `oneshot.yml`.

With the defaults, every cookie slot targets:

```text
ceil(500 / (30 * 2)) = 9
```

Only a topic explicitly returned as `unseen=true` is eligible. It is counted
only after the browser observes an HTTP 200 response from `/topics/timings`
whose submitted `topic_id` matches that topic. A previously read topic with new
replies remains available to the normal reading flow but does not count toward
this target.

#### `LITEFUPZL_TOPIC_PREFETCH_PAGES`

Minimum latest-topic pages fetched before reading. Default: `7`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_TOPIC_PREFETCH_MAX_PAGES`

Maximum latest-topic pages fetched when the unseen pool is still below the
per-run target. Default: `10`.

All four quota variables are optional. When the target is still incomplete,
the remaining slot time is dynamically divided by the number of missing new
topics. Navigation, dwell time, and normal scrolling all use that budget. Once
the target is met, the remaining slot follows the existing reading behavior.

#### `LITEFUPZL_HEADLESS`

Browser headless mode. Use `true` or `false`. Default in Actions: `false`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_BROWSER`

Browser backend to use.

Supported values:

- `chromium`
- `firefox`
- `camoufox`
- `patchright-chromium`

Default in Actions: `chromium`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_PROXY_SERVER`

Proxy URL passed to the browser, for example:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:1080
```

Leave empty for no browser proxy.

#### `LITEFUPZL_VIRTUAL_DISPLAY`

Use a virtual display when running a non-headless browser on Linux. Use `true`
or `false`. Default in Actions: `true`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_OUTPUT_DIR`

Directory for local redacted output files. Default: `output/litefupzl`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_CF_PROBE_URL`

Challenge-probe URL. Set this only to the target you are authorized to test.

#### `LITEFUPZL_CF_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`

Maximum challenge handling time for the challenge probe. Default: `120`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_ACTIONS_RUNS_KEEP`

Number of recent workflow runs to keep during cleanup. Default: `15`.

#### `LITEFUPZL_COOKIE_REFRESH_ENABLED`

Cookie refresh switch for local runs and scheduled GitHub Actions runs. Default:
`true`.

For scheduled GitHub Actions runs, set the repository Variable or Secret
`LITEFUPZL_COOKIE_REFRESH_ENABLED=false` only if you want to disable automatic
validated cookie write-back. Manual runs use the `cookie_refresh_enabled`
workflow input for that single run.

For local runs, use the same names as environment variables or put them in
`.env.local`.

## Manual workflow inputs

### Main run

#### `duration_minutes`

Optional manual runtime override. Leave empty to use
`LITEFUPZL_DURATION_MINUTES`. This value is also per cookie slot.

#### `cookie_refresh_enabled`

Default: `true`. Set to `false` only for a manual run where refreshed cookies
should not be written back to `LITEFUPZL_COOKIES_JSON`.

Scheduled runs do not read this manual input. They use repository secret
`LITEFUPZL_COOKIE_REFRESH_ENABLED` instead.

#### `cookie_refresh_probe`

Set to `true` to run the redacted GitHub secret persistence probe.

#### `upload_artifacts`

Set to `true` to upload redacted debug artifacts for this manual run.

Default: `false`.

### Probe run

#### `probe`

Choose one:

- `auth`: verifies authenticated browser-session access.
- `browser`: runs browser read/timing diagnostics.
- `cf`: runs the configured challenge probe.

#### `upload_artifacts`

Set to `true` to upload redacted debug artifacts for this manual probe run.

Default: `false`.

## Output and logging

Local output files are written under `LITEFUPZL_OUTPUT_DIR`.

Console logs are intentionally coarse-grained and designed to be public-safe:

- raw cookies are redacted;
- usernames are redacted;
- topic ids and topic titles are redacted;
- token values are not printed.

Login verification is shown as a single `login-check` step in console logs.
Detailed login proof events are written only to local output files, which are
uploaded by GitHub Actions only when a manual run sets `upload_artifacts=true`.

Mutual-like console logs show only aggregate state: enabled or skipped, target
count, and total liked count. They do not show usernames, post ids, topic ids,
titles, URLs, or concrete like targets. Per-candidate mutual-like debug records
use aliases such as `target-001` and `candidate-0001` and are written to local
output files only.

For each observed `/topics/timings` request, diagnostics include:

- timestamp;
- slot alias;
- browser backend;
- URL category;
- HTTP status code.

`oneshot_summary.json` also reports `new_topic_target`,
`new_topics_confirmed`, and `new_topic_target_met` for every slot. An exhausted
pool or unmet target is recorded as a warning rather than being reported as a
successful quota.

## Cookie refresh behavior

Cookie refresh is enabled by default.

Manual runs use the `cookie_refresh_enabled` workflow input. Scheduled runs use
repository Variable or Secret `LITEFUPZL_COOKIE_REFRESH_ENABLED`.

When enabled, the runner:

1. extracts refreshed browser cookies from the authenticated context;
2. drops volatile cookies such as `_forum_session` and `cf_clearance`;
3. validates the refreshed cookie in a fresh browser session;
4. writes the validated cookie JSON back to `LITEFUPZL_COOKIES_JSON`.

If validation fails, the secret is not updated.
